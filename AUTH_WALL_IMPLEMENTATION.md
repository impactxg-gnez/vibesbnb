# Authentication Wall Implementation

## Overview

The VibesBNB platform now features a comprehensive authentication wall that requires users to sign up before accessing the main site. This document explains the implementation and user flow.

## User Flow

### For New Users

1. **Welcome Page** (`/welcome`)
   - Beautiful landing page showcasing VibesBNB's value proposition
   - Highlights all 4 user types: Hosts, Travelers, Service Hosts, and Dispensaries
   - CTA buttons: "Get Started" and "Sign In"
   - Stats and feature cards for each user type

2. **Select Role** (`/select-role`)
   - Users choose their role(s) from 4 options:
     - **Host**: List 420-friendly properties and earn income
     - **Traveller**: Discover cannabis-friendly stays and wellness retreats
     - **Service Host**: Offer yoga, massage, and holistic wellness services
     - **Dispensary**: Partner with travelers and reach new customers
   - Beautiful card-based UI with images
   - Multi-role selection support
   - Links to return to welcome page or sign in

3. **Register** (`/register?role=<selected_role>`)
   - Role-specific registration forms:
     - **Host & Traveller**: Personal information (name, DOB, email, password)
     - **Service Host & Dispensary**: Business information (business name, address, tax ID, etc.)
   - Service Host has optional tax ID (required for dispensaries)
   - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy acknowledgment
   - Redirects to appropriate dashboard after registration

### For Returning Users

1. **Login** (`/login`)
   - Multiple login methods:
     - Phone number with SMS verification
     - Email and password
     - SSO (Google, Apple, Facebook)
   - Beautiful centered UI with animated lock icon
   - Links to registration flow

## Protected Routes

The following routes require authentication:

- `/` (Home page with listings and search)
- `/dashboard`
- `/bookings`
- `/itinerary`
- `/favorites`
- `/messages`
- `/profile`
- `/host/dashboard`
- `/search`
- `/listings/*`
- Any other routes not explicitly marked as public

## Public Routes

The following routes are accessible without authentication:

- `/welcome` (Landing page for unauthenticated users)
- `/login`
- `/register`
- `/select-role`
- `/forgot-password`
- `/terms`
- `/privacy`

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### 1. `AuthGuard` Component
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx`
- Wraps all routes to enforce authentication
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/welcome`
- Redirects authenticated users away from auth pages
- Shows loading state while checking authentication

#### 2. `LayoutContent` Component
- Location: `apps/web/src/app/LayoutContent.tsx`
- Conditionally renders Header and Footer
- Hides Header/Footer on full-page routes (welcome, login, register, select-role)
- Wraps content with AuthGuard

#### 3. `WelcomePage` Component
- Location: `apps/web/src/app/welcome/page.tsx`
- Beautiful gradient background with animated elements
- Feature cards for all 4 user types with hover effects
- Stats section showing platform growth
- Responsive design with animations
- Auto-redirects authenticated users to home

### Authentication Context Updates

- Updated `logout()` to redirect to `/welcome` instead of `/`
- Clears all localStorage items including `userRoles` and `activeRole`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing auth flow

### Header Updates

- "Sign Up" button now points to `/select-role` instead of `/register`
- Maintains login link
- Role-specific navigation for authenticated users

### Route Structure

```
/welcome (public, landing page)
  ↓
/select-role (public, role selection)
  ↓
/register?role=<role> (public, registration form)
  ↓
/dashboard or /host/dashboard (protected, based on role)
```

## User Types and Dashboards

- **Traveller**: Redirects to `/dashboard`
